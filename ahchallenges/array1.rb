# Hash Challenges@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

# Challenge 1: Make a hash that contains 
# the following values: 
# "Maya FB Profile" goes with: 19 
# "Cailee FB Profile" goes with 190 
# "Heeba FB profile" goes with 1130 
# "Corey FB profile" goes with 93
# "Grace FB profile" goes with 220 
# "Megan FB profile" goes with 117

fb = {"Maya FB Proflie" => 19 
      "Cailee FB Proflie" => 190
      "Heeba FB Profile" => 1130
      "Corey FB Profile" => 93
      "Grace FB Profile" => 220
      "Megan FB Profile" => 117
}

# Challenge 2: Run your program and check 
# that your hash is set up correctly
# Check that an input of "Megan FB profile" gets 
# back an output of 117

puts fb["Megan FB Profile"]

# Challenge 3: Add the following value to 
# the hash: 
# "Anna FB profile" goes with 1190



# Challenge 4: Iterate (loop) through the hash 
# and return the number of Heeba's friends (you don't 
# need to write a method for this)



# Challenge 5: Iterate (loop) through the 
# hash and return the user who have less 
# than 950 friends (you don't need to write a method
# for this)



# Challenge 6: Iterate (loop) through the hash and return 
# the user who has the most amount of friends associated 
# with their Facebook profile (you don't need to write a   # method for this)



# Challenge 7: Write a method that takes in as two 
# parameters a hash and a number of friends, and checks 
# to see whether there is a Facebook profile in the 
# hash that has that number of friends. 
# if there is a user who has that number of friends, 
# return that use. If there is not one, 
# it should puts "no such user exists"




# Challenge 8: Write a method that takes in as two
#  parameters two hashes and returns true if both hashes  
# have the same exact users in both of them 
# it should return false if there exists a user 
# who is in one hash but not the other
